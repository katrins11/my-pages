                        Taking an internship is a great way to gain knowledge and 
                        experience within a field of work and can be a great stepping 
                        stone into work life. A lot of companies offer internships, 
                        but finding an internship can be a struggle if you don’t know 
                        where to look or know how to start your application process. 
                        This is where Web Intern comes into the picture.

                        the web industry. To put it simply, Web Intern is an internship 
                        portal. The platform hosts internship postings for 
                        companies looking for interns and people can take use of the 
                        platform by browsing through internship postings in search of an
